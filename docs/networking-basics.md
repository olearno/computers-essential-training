### 1. Find Your IP Address

- **Windows:**  
  - Open Command Prompt and run: `ipconfig`
- **Mac/Linux:**

### 3. Static vs Dynamic IP

- **Static IP:** An address that does not change and is set manually.
- **Dynamic IP:** An address assigned automatically by a DHCP server and may change over time.

**Exercise:**  
- Check if your computer is set to use a static or dynamic IP.
  - Windows: Go to Network & Internet settings > Adapter options > Right-click your connection > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties.
  - Mac: System Preferences > Network > Select your connection > Advanced > TCP/IP.
  - Linux: Check your network manager or look for `dhcp` in your config files.
